<h2>Chapter 3 : CyberEgo</h2></p>

<p>With an established context for communication, users of IRC are then faced  </p>

<p>with selecting a person or group of people to talk to and form relationships  </p>

<p>with. In a FTF situation a person may be chosen because of their physical  </p>

<p>attractiveness. Once a conversation is initiated, things will be learned about  </p>

<p>the other person and by identifying things like attitude similarity,  </p>

<p>complementarity, competence, self esteem and positive personal  </p>

<p>characteristics (Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972) in that person, it can be ascertained  </p>

<p>if the relationship is likely to continue. Altman and Taylor (1973) point out  </p>

<p>that it is through reciprocal self disclosure that a person is able to discover  </p>

<p>these things about another: as more layers of the &#8216;onion skin&#8217; personality are  </p>

<p>peeled away, they claim, what the person is really like at the core, or their &#8216;real&#8217;  </p>

<p>self, will be revealed.  <p></p>

<p>These two theories assume that a person has a &#8216;self&#8217; in which their essence can  </p>

<p>be found and which is accessible to other people through the disclosure of  </p>

<p>different aspects of their personality. However, this offers a very self- </p>

<p>contained, unitary and individualistic view of the self, something which  </p>

<p>Burkitt (1991) argues is deeply embedded in the western tradition of thought.  </p>

<p>Instead, he proposes that what is needed is a social understanding of the self  </p>

<p>in which humans can be seen in terms of their social relations with others.  </p>

<p>This does not lessen the notion that humans are individuals, but grapples with  </p>

<p>the possibility of understanding the self as socially based.  <p></p>

<p>One theory that offers a social understanding of the self is the dramaturgical  </p>

<p>model offered by Goffman (1969). He argues that people use information  </p>

<p>gained from others to shape how they should act in a given situation. The  </p>

<p>information is obtained from other people&#8217;s attitudes, competence, individual  </p>

<p>characteristics, conduct, appearance, etc. When encountering someone for the  </p>

<p>first time, how that person acts and what they reveal about themselves will be  </p>

<p>dependent on what the appropriate behaviour for that situation is perceived to  </p>

<p>be. For each situation, then, a particular role is performed. A psychiatrist, for  </p>

<p>example, would not be expected to start telling a patient about their problems.  </p>

<p>Goffman (1969) argues that this is necessary for the smooth flow of social  </p>

<p>life. As a result, people are constantly creating meaningful impressions  </p>

<p>through dress, gesture, muscle tonus, and arrangement of furniture and other  </p>

<p>props as if they were actors performing a role on stage.  <p></p>

<p>Therefore, finding out what a person is &#8216;really&#8217; like is a far more complex  </p>

<p>process than simply disclosing information. The situation, the impression that  </p>

<p>the person gives and the impression that another receives must be taken into  </p>

<p>account. While this is difficult to decipher in a FTF situation, on IRC, users  </p>

<p>have to do this in an altered medium.   <p></p>

<p>As has already been outlined, the medium of IRC has altered the way verbal  </p>

<p>and NVC are used as well as the contexts of communication. In the same  </p>

<p>way, the medium could be said to alter the social settings in which the self is  </p>

<p>identified, and hence the way the self is presented and perceived. Meyrowitz  </p>

<p>(1985) noted that the electronic media altered people&#8217;s behaviour in social  </p>

<p>settings, for example, the merging of male and female roles. While Goffman  </p>

<p>(1969) argued that there were specific roles that people play in different social  </p>

<p>settings, Meyrowitz (1985) sought an answer as to why people were ceasing  </p>

<p>to follow these roles. His answer pointed to the electronic media and its  </p>

<p>confusing of once clear cut social settings. The same has been said about the  </p>

<p>introduction of CMC: &#8220;computer engineers  had understood from the  </p>

<p>beginning the radical changes in social conventions that the nets implied   </p>

<p>they had long ago taken for granted that many of the old assumptions about  </p>

<p>the nature of identity had quietly vanished under the new electronic  </p>

<p>dispensation.&#8221; (Stone, 1991, p 83)   <p></p>

<p>IRC has the same nature: it provides a context for which there are no obvious  </p>

<p>roles on which to base behaviour. In the following discussion it will be seen  </p>

<p>how users of IRC deal with the altered presentation and perception of the self.  </p>

<p>The first section will show how the conventions of relationship formation are  </p>

<p>reproduced despite the medium by looking at: a) how a person is selected, b)  </p>

<p>how conversation is initiated, and c) how information about another is  </p>

<p>discovered. In the second section it will be seen how using IRC alters the  </p>

<p>presentation and perception of the self. It will be also seen how emphasising  </p>

<p>the social nature of self draws attention to issues of power and gender. This  </p>

<p>section will be in three parts: a) how users employ the medium in the  </p>

<p>presentation and perception of self, b) social power relations, and c) gender  </p>

<p>differences.  <p></p>

<h3>Section One : Forming a Relationship  </h3>

<p>When approaching someone on a FTF level to form a relationship, several  </p>

<p>processes come into play: the choice of person to potentially begin a  </p>

<p>relationship with, beginning the conversation and then finding out  </p>

<p>information about that person. These processes are reproduced on IRC but  </p>

<p>take on an altered form due to the nature of the medium.  <p></p>

<p><b>a) Selection   </b><p></p>

<p>Physical attractiveness plays a significant role in the formation of  </p>

<p>relationships on a FTF level (Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972). When first  </p>

<p>approaching a person to talk to, it is usually on the basis that something about  </p>

<p>them was attractive. A person&#8217;s appearance provides information about their  </p>

<p>gender, ethnicity, age, and so on, all of which act to attract another.   <p></p>

<p>On IRC there is no physical person, yet there is some information available  </p>

<p>about a user which can be obtained without speaking to them. In the same  </p>

<p>way that NVC has been textualised, attraction to another person is also  </p>

<p>available in textual cues. The information available to a person wishing to  </p>

<p>make contact with someone on IRC involves the other person&#8217;s nick (or  </p>

<p>nickname), username, address, IRCname, the channel(s) they are on and the  </p>

<p>server they are connected to. This can be obtained using the &#8216;whois&#8217;  </p>

<p>command, for example, typing &#8220;/whois Lisabeth&#8221; will produce:  <p></p>

<p><pre></p>

<p>***Lisabeth is ebyrne@kay.st.nepean.uws.edu.au (StYvain's Ticklemonster  </p>

<p>.... :-) )  </p>

<p>***on @#Aussies  </p>

<p>***on IRC via server kay.st.nepean.uws.edu.au (A machine that Struts)  </p>

<p></pre><p></p>

<p>The nick, &#8216;Lisabeth&#8217;, would indicate that the user is probably female (although  </p>

<p>they could be a male using a female nick). The user name, &#8216;ebyrne&#8217;, gives the  </p>

<p>initial of the first name and the whole last name of the person.  </p>

<p>&#8216;Kay.st.nepean.uws.edu.au&#8217; is the person&#8217;s email address and indicates that  </p>

<p>they have an account on a machine called kay (kay.st) at the University of  </p>

<p>Western Sydney, Nepean (nepean.uws) which is an educational institution  </p>

<p>(edu) in Australia (au). This would assume that the person went to that  </p>

<p>university, but that is not always the case as it may be just one of many  </p>

<p>accounts the person has. The statement in parentheses is the IRCname which  </p>

<p>usually contains the person&#8217;s full name, but can be altered to say anything  </p>

<p>about themselves that they like. Other information available is that the person  </p>

<p>is on #Aussies and is connected to server kay. This information does not  </p>

<p>really give any accurate information about or picture of what the person is  </p>

<p>like. As Reid (1991) says, &#8220;[e]ssentially there is nothing that one IRC user can  </p>

<p>ascertain about another ( beyond the fact that they have access to the Internet  </p>

<ul>
<li>that is not manipulable by that user.&#8221;  <p></li>
</ul>

<p>With the absence of the physical dimension, users have come to find other  </p>

<p>things about a person on IRC attractive in the initial stages of interaction.  </p>

<p>Participants of the survey were asked what it was about a person that made  </p>

<p>them want to initiate conversation. The most common response was that the  </p>

<p>nick attracted them. This aspect was also reflected in one of the interviews:  <p></p>

<p>H: <i>Well, I mean you see somebody&#8217;s name, you like their name and you say  </p>

<p>&#8220;cute nick&#8221; and they respond back &#8220;oh thanks, how did you get your nick?&#8221;  </i><p></p>

<p>The nick is chosen by the user under which they will interact on IRC. These  </p>

<p>nicks can range from the ordinary to the bizarre. There are normal nicks  </p>

<p>which are just the first name of the user like Andrew, Jason, Lisa, etc; ones  </p>

<p>which take on characters such as MMouse, Pooky, IndyJones, etc; and more  </p>

<p>inventive and unusual ones like PlayDough, StYvain, Prism, Uneak, etc.  </p>

<p>These nicks provide one picture of what a person is like.   <p></p>

<p>In light of Goffman&#8217;s (1969) argument, the choice of a nick may in fact be part  </p>

<p>of a role they wish to play on IRC. In the following log it can be seen how a  </p>

<p>nick conveys certain attributes of person to another:  <p></p>

<p><pre></p>

<p><em>TopGun</em> love ur nick  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> why thank you :)  </p>

<p><em>TopGun</em> it's unusual and sweeet  </p>

<p></pre><p>  </p>

<p>This log also provides a good example of a person with a nick conveying  </p>

<p>images of a movie and a particular actor. By using the nick &#8216;TopGun&#8217;, the user  </p>

<p>may be trying to portray a certain image about themselves.  <p></p>

<p>Despite the perceived importance of looks in the formation of FTF  </p>

<p>relationships, physical attractiveness in the usual sense is absent on IRC.  </p>

<p>Given the centrality that this appears to have in relationship formation  </p>

<p>(Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972) this factor seemingly turns relationship formation  </p>

<p>on its head in CMC. Instead of relying on the outside features of a person to  </p>

<p>attract someone, they must work from the other side and look at the person&#8217;s  </p>

<p>personality and way of presenting themselves to help decide whether to  </p>

<p>initiate a conversation or not. As Rheingold (1994, p 26) says, &#8220;we are  </p>

<p>accustomed to meeting people, then getting to know them;&#8221; whereas on IRC,  </p>

<p>&#8220;you can get to know people and then choose to meet them.&#8221;  <p></p>

<p><b>) Initiating Conversation  </b><p></p>

<p>When meeting someone on a FTF level, the most common beginning to a  </p>

<p>conversation is often &#8216;hello, how are you?&#8217; The use of this phrase as a greeting  </p>

<p>became popular after widespread use of the telephone which required a  </p>

<p>formalised technique for acknowledgment of conversation. On IRC, saying  </p>

<p>&#8220;hello&#8221; was found from the survey to be one of the most common forms of  </p>

<p>initiating a conversation. Other common methods included making a witty  </p>

<p>comment, or being introduced by someone else. These forms of greeting are  </p>

<p>the same whether sending someone a private message or speaking publicly on  </p>

<p>a channel. The following log shows how conversation is typically initiated  </p>

<p>when joining a channel:  <p></p>

<p><pre>  </p>

<p>*** Pug ... has joined channel #aussies  </p>

<p>[Pug] ello all  </p>

<p>[Lisabeth] hi pug  </p>

<p>[jpark] pug where are you talking from  </p>

<p>[Pug] jpark :im in cape town  </p>

<p>[jpark] pug where the hell is that I am in Sydney  </p>

<p>[jpark] pug are you a Dutch or English?  </p>

<p>[Pug] jpark :u got a lot to learn  </p>

<p>[Zeb] jpark : the bottom of South Africa  </p>

<p>[jpark] pug Such as What?  </p>

<p>[Lot] jpark: now you have a Lot to learn.. hehehehe  </p>

<p>[Pug] jpark: its english or afrikaans  </p>

<p>[Striker] Pug, ben jij afrikaans?  </p>

<p>[Pug] jpark :the dutch people were here about 300 years ago and the climate  </p>

<p>screwed them up so they become afrikaaners  </p>

<p>[jpark] pug You are right. Are you a Afrikaanor or an English  </p>

<p>[Pug] well im actually dutch ,but i grew up here being an english person  </p>

<p></pre><p> </p>

<p>In this log, a few users made the decision to talk to the person who had joined  </p>

<p>the channel. However, not all attempts at conversation are met with such  </p>

<p>good fortune. Some users of IRC try to get to know someone by sending a  </p>

<p>private message to a nick that they have picked at random from a list of  </p>

<p>names. The problem with doing that is that the person may not even be there.  </p>

<p>It is also possible to ignore someone on IRC. In FTF communication if  </p>

<p>someone approaches another and says hello, the encounter is unavoidable, no  </p>

<p>matter how short it may end up being. However, if conversation is not  </p>

<p>welcomed, the &#8220;/ignore nick all&#8221; command can be used which will physically  </p>

<p>prevent messages from that person reaching the target nick. Following is a log  </p>

<p>of someone who has tried to initiate conversation and fails:   <p></p>

<p><pre>  </p>

<p><em>rma</em> I'm kinda horny...can we talk?  </p>

<p><em>rma</em> hello?  </p>

<p>*** rma is ... (Fuzz Buzz)  </p>

<p>*** on channels: #aussies   </p>

<p>*** Ignoring ALL messages from RMA  </p>

<p></pre><p>  </p>

<p>Making contact with someone on IRC typically involves the exchange of  </p>

<p>presented biographical information. Finding out more of such information  </p>

<p>can become the basis of the next stage of the relationship formation process.  <p></p>

<p><b>c) Finding out Information  </b><p></p>

<p>Once two parties to a conversation willingly communicate, information needs  </p>

<p>to be exchanged to further the relationship. This is achieved by asking  </p>

<p>questions of another such as: Where are you from? Do you go to university?  </p>

<p>What is your real name? What are your interests? This form of information  </p>

<p>exchange is closely linked with the idea of reciprocal self disclosure. Both  </p>

<p>Levinger and Snoek (1972) and Altman and Taylor (1973) point to this aspect  </p>

<p>as important in the relationship formation process. Without the disclosure of  </p>

<p>information a person can only find out limited information about another.  <p></p>

<p>While disclosure of information takes place in a similar way on IRC, users  </p>

<p>must rely on what another user tells them. The information obtained will then  </p>

<p>depend on the impression that the user is trying to convey (Goffman, 1969, p  </p>

<p>13). However, if users do not disclose any information about themselves then  </p>

<p>conversation becomes difficult to sustain and appropriate behaviour for the  </p>

<p>situation is unattainable. However, if one person in an interaction discloses  </p>

<p>too much information too soon then the other person may not want to talk  </p>

<p>again. When participants in the survey were asked what it was that deterred  </p>

<p>them from talking to another IRC user again, the disclosure of too much  </p>

<p>information was a major factor.  <p></p>

<p>While the disclosure of information is important, it appears that not everyone  </p>

<p>is happy to disclose everything about themselves in an initial encounter.  </p>

<p>Levinger and Snoek (1972) link self disclosure to appropriateness: when to  </p>

<p>disclose and to whom. Survey participants were asked what type of  </p>

<p>information they were willing to disclose to another in an initial conversation  </p>

<p>on IRC. It was found that initially most people did not like to disclose  </p>

<p>personal problems, while information about occupation, gender, location,  </p>

<p>ethnicity and age were more readily revealed. This points to a sense of  </p>

<p>appropriateness of self disclosure for users of IRC. Just as in a FTF situation,  </p>

<p>users decide what sorts of aspects they will disclose and to whom depending  </p>

<p>on the situation and the impression they wish to create (Goffman, 1969, p 13).  <p></p>

<p>Once the flow of conversation has been established, further factors influence  </p>

<p>the decision over whether to continue the association made, such as,  </p>

<p>commonality, complementarity, competence and other positive personal  </p>

<p>characteristics.   <p></p>

<p>Finding someone with similar ideas or with whom there is something in  </p>

<p>common will often serve to facilitate the continuation of a relationship  </p>

<p>(Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972). When IRC users find common ground,  </p>

<p>conversation is fuelled and relationships begin to form. The following log  </p>

<p>shows how finding commonality works to attract someone and in turn  </p>

<p>encourage further disclosure:  <p></p>

<p><pre>  </p>

<p>[Lisabeth] hello all :)  </p>

<p>[hart] hi Lisabeth  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> one of my tutors at uni's name is Hart... you aren't jewish by any  </p>

<p>chance?  </p>

<p><em>hart</em> nope, non-practicing Catholic  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> ah ok.. so where you from?  </p>

<p><em>hart</em> Nashville Tennessee USA, I visit #aussies quite a bit...probably at odd  </p>

<p>times for u tho  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> uh huh... I see.. never been there myself. I am very regular on  </p>

<h1>aussies... know most of the ppl there in rea life</h1>

<p><em>hart</em> it is the home of country music... I know Striker, CaT, and  </p>

<p>Nexuz...that's usually who I talk to.  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> I met striker at a party the other night... interesting guy  </p>

<p><em>hart</em> really?  we started talking when he found out that my dogs name was  </p>

<p>Stryker.  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> heh :) yeah, its funny how most ppl start talking because they find  </p>

<p>something they have in common... can't really start a relationships anyother  </p>

<p>way on this thing  </p>

<p></pre><p>  </p>

<p>Commonality was also found to be a major factor in continuing to talk to  </p>

<p>someone among participants of the survey.   <p></p>

<p>Finding complementarity with another person also brings people into  </p>

<p>relationships (Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972). It is quite common for an introvert  </p>

<p>and an extrovert to form a relationship, or for a dominant person and a  </p>

<p>submissive person to form one. This is also the case on IRC. The person who  </p>

<p>displays a characteristic that a user admires or desires for themselves may  </p>

<p>influence them to talk to and develop a relationship with that person. In one  </p>

<p>of the interviews, an interviewee expressed how he fell naturally into a  </p>

<p>dominant/submissive relationship with another on IRC:  <p></p>

<p>T: <i>Well, I wandered on the channel and there were quite a few other people  </p>

<p>there and, lets see, I really don&#8217;t know, we sort seemed to immediately fall  </p>

<p>into a very compatible dominant submissive relationship.  </i><br></p>

<p>Elisabeth: <i>She had all the right ways of putting things?  </i><br></p>

<p>T: <i>Yeah.  </i><p></p>

<p>In this example, the two people met on #BDSM where dominant and  </p>

<p>submissive relationships are commonplace. This is one channel where roles  </p>

<p>are played out. In other channels, playing a role may be seen as dishonest, but  </p>

<p>as Goffman (1969) points out, every presentation of the self is like playing a  </p>

<p>role.  <p></p>

<p>Competence is another characteristic that will often play an important part in  </p>

<p>the formation of a relationship. People are often attracted to others who are  </p>

<p>intelligent, successful and competent rather than those who are less so  </p>

<p>(Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972). Competence plays a big role in the formation of  </p>

<p>some relationships on IRC, especially between the new user of IRC and an  </p>

<p>IRC operator. New people to IRC are often lost as to what to do or how to  </p>

<p>execute a particular command and will ask a operator for help. One of the  </p>

<p>interviewees who is an IRC operator spoke about his experience:  <p></p>

<p>M:<i>Sometimes people will message me and tell me that someone is pissing  </p>

<p>them off. The first thing you say to them is well, ignore them. If the say they  </p>

<p>can&#8217;t ignore them, I&#8217;ll have a go at that person, I&#8217;ll really fly into that person. I  </p>

<p>find that it works well and you impress the girls cause its all very chivalrous  </p>

<p>and stuff. Like M to the rescue, but umm, I think the asking for help is a good  </p>

<p>one.</i><p>  </p>

<p>Aside from competence, there are thought to be other positive personal  </p>

<p>characteristics which people view as good and therefore likeable in a person  </p>

<p>(Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972). In the survey, participants indicated certain  </p>

<p>characteristics that are valued highly on IRC including: people who are &#8220;nice&#8221;,  </p>

<p>people who treat others with respect, those who are intelligent, and those  </p>

<p>people who helped with a problem. While many users did not like to reveal  </p>

<p>their personal problems to people they had just met on IRC, some people  </p>

<p>take advantage of the fact that the person is a total stranger:  <p></p>

<p>You don&#8217;t know the person so you tend to tell them about your problems.  </p>

<p>You are almost sure that they don&#8217;t blab about your problems and you don&#8217;t  </p>

<p>know them that well, so you tend to have an image of them of being good  </p>

<p>and trusting.  <p></p>

<p>Being able to trust someone is something highly valued on IRC and is an  </p>

<p>important part in the successful formation of relationships. However, because  </p>

<p>of the medium of IRC, users have trouble working out if someone is  </p>

<p>trustworthy. It will now be shown how users deal with and exploit the  </p>

<p>medium in which trust is diminished.  <p></p>

<h4>Section Two ( Presenting and Perceiving the Self  </h4>

<p>When presenting selves on a FTF level, it is assumed that the basic things of  </p>

<p>appearance cannot be altered. However, on IRC people are invisible so how a  </p>

<p>&#8220;user &#8216;looks&#8217; to another user is entirely dependent upon information supplied  </p>

<p>by that person. It [therefore] becomes possible to play with identity.&#8221; (Reid,  </p>

<p>1991) In this situation some users take advantage of not being able to be seen  </p>

<p>and say things about themselves which are exaggerated or untrue. For some  </p>

<p>users, this creates anxiety over what the other person is &#8216;really like&#8217;.   <p></p>

<p>The ability to manipulate the self on CMC also involves a dimension of  </p>

<p>power. In developing a social understanding of the self there is a need to  </p>

<p>understand the ways in which power is always involved in any human  </p>

<p>relationship, especially where class, ethnicity and gender are concerned.  <p></p>

<p><b>d) The Altered Self  </b><p></p>

<p>The conscious changing of personality on IRC may be linked to a person&#8217;s  </p>

<p>self esteem. Being liked by another person is an important source of self  </p>

<p>esteem (Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972), so when forming relationships, a person  </p>

<p>who is feeling confident about themselves may not be so worried about what  </p>

<p>others will think of them, but if their self esteem is low, they may not be  </p>

<p>confident and change aspects of themselves to appear more attractive to  </p>

<p>others.   <p></p>

<p>Participants of the survey were asked if they thought there was a difference  </p>

<p>between people on IRC to people in a FTF setting. While some participants  </p>

<p>said that there was no difference, a majority of participants stated that people  </p>

<p>are different because the absence of the physical dimension allows a person  </p>

<p>to deliberately change aspects of their personality. One participant stated that:  </p>

<p>&#8220;IRC friends are acquaintances. I don&#8217;t &#8216;know&#8217; them as I would a friend in real  </p>

<p>life. I can only know what they tell me.&#8221;  <p></p>

<p>This changing personality and appearance is quite common on IRC. Most  </p>

<p>people admit to lying about themselves at some stage in their conversations  </p>

<p>on IRC. Participants of the survey indicated that people did this because they  </p>

<p>either did not like who they were, it was easier to be someone else on IRC or  </p>

<p>that it was fun to trick people. One participant stated that &#8220;its relaxing,  </p>

<p>entertaining and liberating to be someone else for a while. I have more control  </p>

<p>over what people know about me, therefore I have more control over who  </p>

<p>they think I am and what they think of me&#8221;. One interviewee described how  </p>

<p>he sometimes took advantage of being &#8216;invisible&#8217;:  <p></p>

<p>B:<i> Yeah, I lie about my appearance. I say I am five foot three, mohawk, kilt,  </p>

<p>fish net singlet top and doc martins. The only reason I tell them this is that I  </p>

<p>don&#8217;t feel like telling them what I look like. I mean anyone looking like that   </p>

<p>it is always taken as a joke and sometimes you get interesting responses. But  </p>

<p>that is the only time I take advantage of being invisible.  </i><p></p>

<p>This ability to alter the self leads to questions of whether people can in fact  </p>

<p>form relationships with people who are deliberately changing their  </p>

<p>personalities. People feel cheated or deceived if they discover that the other  </p>

<p>person is nothing like what they thought they were. As one interviewee said: &#8221;  </p>

<p> you rely a lot more on their honesty and integrity&#8221;. One example of  </p>

<p>extreme deception was brought up by another interviewee:  <p></p>

<p>B: <i>Like I&#8217;ve sat behind a guy who changed his nick to a female and had net  </p>

<p>sex with this guy while all these people were watching him. So like I have this  </p>

<p>total caution with IRC relationships cause things like that can happen.  </i><p></p>

<p>This is what one participant of the survey stated was the &#8220;enjoyment of self- </p>

<p>congratulatory, risk-free, one-upmanship&#8221;.  <p></p>

<p>To work out whether someone is in fact as they say they are, many people  </p>

<p>resort to other media of communication once a relationship is established.  </p>

<p>Many participants of the survey stated that they did not have a genuine  </p>

<p>relationship with another until they had met FTF. As one participant said:  </p>

<p>&#8220;They often remain superficial, they normally need contact outside IRC  </p>

<p>before I&#8217;ll commit to the long term effort.&#8221;  <p></p>

<p>Rheingold (1994) notes that &#8220;You can be fooled about people in cyberspace,  </p>

<p>behind the cloak of words. But that can be said about telephones or FTF  </p>

<p>communication as well; computer-mediated communications provide new  </p>

<p>ways to fool people, and the most obvious identity swindles will die out only  </p>

<p>when enough people learn to use the medium critically.&#8221; (p 27) This suggests  </p>

<p>that people are deceived no matter what the medium of communication. Just  </p>

<p>as people have to learn to work out when someone is lying to them FTF, so  </p>

<p>too do users of IRC. One interviewee suggested that it may not matter if the  </p>

<p>other person is lying or not:  <p></p>

<p>B: <i>A friend of mine once got the question of what if these people where just  </p>

<p>highly intelligent robots.   </i><br></p>

<p>Elisabeth: <i>That&#8217;s scary.  </i><br></p>

<p>B: <i>To me it&#8217;s not. I mean so what? I mean you come on here to talk to people,  </p>

<p>you are having a conversation and you found out that this person was Asian  </p>

<p>rather than Anglo-Saxon: would it matter? I don&#8217;t think so. What happens if it  </p>

<p>was Irish instead of American? It doesn&#8217;t matter, you are still having that  </p>

<p>conversation. So, along those lines if it was a robot and it was still intelligent  </p>

<p>enough to have conversation with you, why should it matter?  </i><p></p>

<p>While some people will change themselves, this may not be the deception  </p>

<p>that it first appears to be. Reid (1991) quotes one user of IRC who states that  </p>

<p>&#8221;  if it occurs to you to enact it then it is part of your potentiality&#8221;. It may be  </p>

<p>that the ability to enact this altered self is in fact just as valid a presentation of  </p>

<p>self as any other. Following Goffman (1969) the &#8216;altered identity&#8217; presented on  </p>

<p>IRC would be just another role acted out by that person due to the situation.  </p>

<p>As one survey participant said: &#8220;It seems to be fun, like acting on stage&#8221;. This  </p>

<p>does not make the person any less real, but by creating a certain impression  </p>

<p>on IRC, the person is performing a self and providing expectations about their  </p>

<p>behaviour both to others and themselves.   <p></p>

<p>Not everyone intentionally sets out to alter their personalities on IRC. In fact,  </p>

<p>some participants of the survey believed that there was no difference between  </p>

<p>them on IRC and them in a FTF setting. Even so, the medium itself appears to  </p>

<p>alter the way a person comes across on IRC. When interacting with someone  </p>

<p>over a period of time, a mental picture of that person is built up then when the  </p>

<p>people meet FTF it is often the case that the person is completely different to  </p>

<p>what they were perceived to be. So even though one person may not be  </p>

<p>intentionally setting out to deceive someone, the person perceiving them  </p>

<p>commonly ends up with misconceptions about that person because of the  </p>

<p>medium (Fuller, 1994). One interviewee expressed concern over this point:  <p></p>

<p>M:<i> People are different on IRC than in real life.  </i><br></p>

<p>Elisabeth:<i> What sort of things make it so different?  </i><br></p>

<p>M:<i> I think it is the person. &#8216;Cause when you start talking to someone you  </p>

<p>immediate start building up an image of them. That image doesn&#8217;t have to be a  </p>

<p>visual image at all it can just be a personality picture and even the time that  </p>

<p>you are talking to people. I mean if you are talking to the same people at the  </p>

<p>same time every night and its say ten o&#8217;clock then you are speaking to them  </p>

<p>when they are tired and if you went over to their place at that time you might  </p>

<p>find that they are the same on IRC as in real life. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised.  </i><br></p>

<p>Elisabeth: <i>So what about people who are different on IRC? Is that because  </p>

<p>you don&#8217;t know them in person? Is it is just another aspect of their  </p>

<p>personality?  </i><br></p>

<p>M:<i> I think it is a subset of their personality. You don&#8217;t get people making  </p>

<p>spontaneous outbursts, you have to type it first.  </i><p></p>

<p>Personal perceptions are seen as important in both social penetration theory  </p>

<p>(Altman &amp;  Taylor, 1973) and social presence theory (Short, et al, 1976).  </p>

<p>Perceiving another person&#8217;s self is also something that Goffman (1969)  </p>

<p>expresses. He says that there is the impression given by the person and the  </p>

<p>impression received by others. In this sense IRC is then no different to FTF  </p>

<p>communication as there is always the problem of presentation and  </p>

<p>perception.  <p></p>

<p>Many of the implications of presenting the self have been seen to be negative.  </p>

<p>However, being able to alter the self has in fact empowered users of IRC to  </p>

<p>develop aspects of their personality not normally seen on a FTF level. As  </p>

<p>Rheingold (1994) says: &#8220;In some ways, the medium will, by its nature, be  </p>

<p>forever biased toward certain kinds of obfuscation. It will also be a place that  </p>

<p>people often end up revealing themselves far more intimately than they would  </p>

<p>be inclined to do without the intermediation of screens and pseudonyms.&#8221; (p  </p>

<p>27) Many people have found that IRC has liberated them to express  </p>

<p>themselves as they never were able to in a FTF situation. Following is an  </p>

<p>example of how IRC has helped one person to open up and discover things  </p>

<p>about themselves:  <p></p>

<p>Chris: <i> before I IRCed, I felt I couldn&#8217;t afford to be open, that I couldn&#8217;t be  </p>

<p>open. With IRC its just text, it&#8217;s less confronting, but you also have a lot more  </p>

<p>there if you&#8217;re not just doing it for the sake of having nothing to do on a  </p>

<p>Saturday afternoon. You are really interacting with people, you have nothing  </p>

<p>else but openness. You can always pin a relationship on sex or whatever in  </p>

<p>real life, but on the net its all about communication.  </i><p></p>

<p>This is one of the more positive points of IRC. If it is possible to liberate  </p>

<p>people, it may be that other factors in relationships are also altered and allow  </p>

<p>communication free from inherent biases. Nevertheless, these potentially  </p>

<p>liberatory dimensions of CMC have to be juxtaposed with the recognition  </p>

<p>that social relations also may involve questions of power. Any new  </p>

<p>communications technology is introduced into existing arrangements of  </p>

<p>difference and inequality (Gray, 1993), and must therefore involve negotiation  </p>

<p>around these structures. As a new medium, however, with the potential to  </p>

<p>reshape human relationships, it may also generate new forms of power and  </p>

<p>inequality.  <p></p>

<p><b>b) Social Power Relations  </b><p></p>

<p>Relationships do not necessarily form between two equal individuals. This is  </p>

<p>something that both relationship formation theories (Altman &amp;  Taylor, 1973;  </p>

<p>Levinger &amp;  Snoek, 1972) fail to take into account. Whether a relationship  </p>

<p>forms between two people of a different ethnicity, class or gender, there are  </p>

<p>always expected social roles to be taken into account centred around power  </p>

<p>differences.  <p></p>

<p>Elias (1978) argues that all social relations are bonded and changed by varying  </p>

<p>balances of power between different groups and individuals. He argues that  </p>

<p>power is not something that is imposed on others, but rather it is a relation  </p>

<p>between individuals or groups. It is very rarely the case that an individual or  </p>

<p>group will not have some form of power or influence, as even the most  </p>

<p>powerful group is interdependent on the group that they dominate. For Elias  </p>

<p>(1978), then, &#8220;power is not an amulet possessed by one person and not by  </p>

<p>another; it is a structural characteristic of human relationships ( of ALL  </p>

<p>human relationships&#8221; (p 74).  <p></p>

<p>These power differences are also apparent on IRC, but they are altered due to  </p>

<p>the medium. Meyrowitz (1985) argues that the traditional roles played in  </p>

<p>relationships of difference, especially those of masculinity and femininity, are  </p>

<p>merging because of new technology. By exposing each gender to each other&#8217;s  </p>

<p>roles through information systems, the more difficult it becomes to maintain  </p>

<p>the traditional distinctions between male and female. This argument may also  </p>

<p>be applied to differences of class and ethnicity.  <p></p>

<p>The distinctions of social class and ethnicity are largely unavailable on IRC  </p>

<p>because of the absence of the physical dimension. As has been outlined  </p>

<p>above, there is no completely accurate way of obtaining this information  </p>

<p>about users. The more utopian view of this is that conversations and  </p>

<p>relationships form between formerly unlikely people, therefore indicating that  </p>

<p>there has been a change in traditional power relations. Without the initial  </p>

<p>knowledge about someone&#8217;s class or ethnicity, traditional stereotypes and  </p>

<p>power relations are not brought into play in the formation of relationships.  </p>

<p>Many participants of the survey indicted this in their comments:  <p></p>

<p>Because people are more relaxed and any social barriers are surpassed by the  </p>

<p>computer, &#8216;cause nobody knows what you are and you cannot be labelled and  </p>

<p>condemned out of hand.  <p></p>

<p>Yet, as Sutton (1994) argues, information about class and ethnicity on IRC is  </p>

<p>available in the type of discourse used. This is obvious in the way many  </p>

<p>people present themselves on IRC. This is the result of socialisation that is not  </p>

<p>always conscious, yet it means that people classify others into groups.  <p></p>

<p>Social class is not an obvious distinction on IRC, partly because the majority  </p>

<p>of users come from a similar socioeconomic and educational background.  </p>

<p>Reid (1993) found that most users of the Internet were in fact male, white and  </p>

<p>affluent. This was reflected in the survey results for this study with the  </p>

<p>majority of participants being 19-25 year old males studying some form of  </p>

<p>computing or, having graduated, working in the computer industry.  <p></p>

<p>Ethnicity, in some senses, is more readily distinguished on IRC. In every  </p>

<p>user&#8217;s &#8216;whois&#8217; there is at least an indicator as to what country they are in. It  </p>

<p>appears also be one of the more common questions asked of a new person  </p>

<p>met on IRC. In some circumstances ethnicity does not matter on IRC; users  </p>

<p>feel that they can talk to anyone without bringing &#8216;difference&#8217; into the  </p>

<p>relationship. In other cases, ethnicity is defined clearly by the name of the  </p>

<p>channels. While the dominant language used on IRC is English, there are  </p>

<p>some channels where a particular language is spoken and this will obviously  </p>

<p>prevent some users being able to enter the conversation.  <p></p>

<p>In traditional distinctions of power, there is usually some form of hierarchy  </p>

<p>among the social classes of society. A new form of hierarchical distinction is  </p>

<p>created by users of IRC based on access to the privileges associated with  </p>

<p>being an operator. This distinction is one that users learn about as they use  </p>

<p>IRC:  <p></p>

<p><pre>  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> so you can establish a sorta power thing here...  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> yeah but on here...  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> some users carry more weight than others...  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> sorta heirachy  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> but unwritten  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> but then there is also a heirarchy in real life too  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> and not to mention ircops...  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> yeah but this is irc  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> its all virtual...  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> so.. I still say it is merely a subset of real life  </p>

<p><em>Mistic</em> it is  </p>

<p></pre><p>  </p>

<p>At the top of the hierarchy are the IRC operators who maintain and look after  </p>

<p>their IRC server. These people have the ability to &#8216;kill&#8217; a user and even stop  </p>

<p>their access to IRC. Reid (1991) says that this power serves to &#8220;unite them as  </p>

<p>an authoritative class&#8221;. These operators are often the subject of hate and  </p>

<p>violent threats from users who dislike them:  <p></p>

<p>M: <i> I have been lately hassled by this guy from UTS. He was hassling  </p>

<p>Spesh asking if she was female and all those evil things that people normally  </p>

<p>do on IRC. I messaged him and told him to stop and so he started threatening  </p>

<p>me and so when he started being really rude, I logged it all and sent it straight  </p>

<p>off to the administrator at UTS who had his account locked. A week later he  </p>

<p>got the account back and now he is hassling me again. He thinks he is really  </p>

<p>smart &#8216;cause he keeps using different nick names. </i><br>  </p>

<p>E:<i> Do you think if it was in real life would you do the same thing?  </i><br></p>

<p>M:<i> I would probably do all that was in my power to help. But you must  </p>

<p>remember that on IRC I am in a position of power </i><p>  </p>

<p>Under IRC operators are the channel operators who have access to more  </p>

<p>commands than the ordinary user. Then there are the new users of IRC or the  </p>

<p>&#8220;newbies&#8221; who have only just begun to use IRC. These people are often  </p>

<p>subject to victimisation because they do not know enough about IRC.  <p></p>

<p>System operators, even more so than IRC users generally, are typically male,  </p>

<p>suggesting that the question of gender relations on IRC is also a question of  </p>

<p>power.  <p></p>

<p><b>c) Gender  </b><p></p>

<p>Both Altman and Taylor (1973) and Levinger and Snoek (1972) deal with the  </p>

<p>formation of romantic relationships in their studies. They appear to account  </p>

<p>for the movement to love and marriage as the result of increased intimacy and  </p>

<p>self disclosure after finding another who is compatible. However, these  </p>

<p>theorists have failed to address the roles that gender and power play in the  </p>

<p>formation of these relationships.   <p></p>

<p>Traditionally the power relationship between males and females has been  </p>

<p>delineated by distinct roles for each gender. For Gilbert and Taylor (1991)  </p>

<p>these roles come from a historically constructed pattern of power relations  </p>

<p>between men and women. Feminist theorising has used the concept of  </p>

<p>patriarchy to explain these power relations, pointing to a male domination  </p>

<p>over females. Masculinity has been characterised by power, authority,  </p>

<p>aggression, and technical competence. Femininity is thought to complement  </p>

<p>this with compliance, subordination, sociability, sexual passivity and  </p>

<p>acceptance of domesticity and motherhood. (Gilbert and Taylor, 1991, p 10)  <p></p>

<p>The linking of technical competence and masculinity is seen in the creation  </p>

<p>and mastering of cyberspace by males. Turkle (1984) argues that it is males  </p>

<p>who traditionally shy away from relationships with humans and engage in  </p>

<p>extended sessions with the computer in an effort to develop mastery over the  </p>

<p>equipment. This type of behaviour is best demonstrated by hackers who push  </p>

<p>themselves beyond the limit of mind and body in a bid to conquer  </p>

<p>technology. Easthope (1986) argues that these characteristics are a result of  </p>

<p>the fact that the male ego is essentially defined around power and control,  </p>

<p>over the body, emotions, others, women and nature.  <p></p>

<p>On IRC it is not possible for males to totally maintain their control over  </p>

<p>technology and women. With the absence of the physical dimension, gender  </p>

<p>is not as easily deciphered as in a FTF situation. It is possible then to be which  </p>

<p>ever gender a person desires. As Reid (1991) notes, gender reassignment is a  </p>

<p>very involved process in &#8216;real life&#8217;, but on IRC &#8220;gender changing is as simple  </p>

<p>as changing one&#8217;s nickname&#8221;. Gender is thought to be one of the more sacred  </p>

<p>institutions in society, and with the unsurety that IRC presents for people,  </p>

<p>there is a certain anxiety about forming relationships. For many people it is  </p>

<p>most important that they know whether the person is male or female:  <p></p>

<p><pre>  </p>

<p><em>hart</em> ...this guy thought I was a guy until he asked about my sweetie...I said  </p>

<p>he was alseep in the next room...You could almost here his mind whirling.  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> heh :) some ppl are just too hung up on whether we are guys or  </p>

<p>girls on this thing  </p>

<p><em>hart</em> yeah, and with my nick it is hard to tell....  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> i will admit to not being sure about your gender... basically  </p>

<p>because my tutor is male and that is his name... but I am not really worried  </p>

<p>about whether I talk to guys or girls  </p>

<p><em>hart</em> I'm female. but I kinda like the anonimity...   </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> yeah... mine is very female and i often get hassled by guys  </p>

<p>because of it  </p>

<p><em>hart</em> probably not as much as someone named SexGoddess!  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> no, I would hope not...   </p>

<p></pre><p>  </p>

<p>People often feel cheated if they find someone using an opposite gendered  </p>

<p>nick to their true gender. Reid (1993) notes that people have three different  </p>

<p>reactions to someone using an opposite gendered nick: they either feel  </p>

<p>cheated, they feel it is unethical or they feel uncomfortable and at a  </p>

<p>disadvantage not knowing:   <p></p>

<p>B:<i> Like I&#8217;ve sat behind a guy who changed his nick to a female and had net  </p>

<p>sex with this guy while all these ppl were watching him. So like I have this  </p>

<p>total caution with IRC relationships cause things like that can happen.  </i><p></p>

<p>However, despite this potential, with a majority of males on the Internet, they  </p>

<p>still try to reproduce the roles in the way they traditionally treat females. Reid  </p>

<p>(1993) finds that females are &#8220;often subjected to virtual forms of those two  </p>

<p>hoary sides of a male-dominated society ( harassment and chivalry.&#8221; The  </p>

<p>following log gives an example of a typical harassment:  <p></p>

<p><pre>  </p>

<p><em>havoc</em> hello  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> hi, how are you?  </p>

<p><em>havoc</em> good...are you in australia?  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> yep, sure am  </p>

<p><em>havoc</em> thats so cool...are you one of those gorgeous Australian women?  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> I could be... aks around the channel.. they'll tell you  </p>

<p><em>havoc</em> really...do you have a reputation on the channel?  </p>

<p><em>havoc</em> should i ask now?  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> if you like  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> go right ahead... be my guest  </p>

<p>[havoc] whats Lisabeth like?  Is she hot?  </p>

<p>[jenky] she sizzles  </p>

<p></pre><p>  </p>

<p>It is ironic that many forms of harassment lead to chivalry on the part of other  </p>

<p>males. The following log shows how one male is chivalrous to a female by  </p>

<p>threatening a guy who has been hassling her:  <p></p>

<p><pre>  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> stop hasseling uws people.  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> (first warning)  </p>

<p><em>GM</em> you don't scare me  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> obviously you are a complete moron then.  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> ooohh aaaahh  </p>

<p><em>GM</em> i am not a moron.....i am extremely clever  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> uh ha. right. you are so clever, you hassel a girl who is over  </p>

<p>1500kms away telling her you want her body. i see.  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> very clever  </p>

<p><em>GM</em> correct...is there something wrong with wanting her body  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> a little bit of a social outcast are we?  </p>

<p><em>GM</em> got it in one!  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> well- it's called sexual harrassment. if you dont stop it, then  </p>

<p>things will happen to you.   </p>

<p><em>GM</em> what things?  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> well, i am an irc op for one. secondly, i can have you banned  </p>

<p>from irc. if harrassment continues, i'll report it to your admin, and your accnt  </p>

<p>will be closed.  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> go read swin's rules on user harrassment  </p>

<p><em>GM</em> sounds pretty bad...in other words you can really stuff me up?  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> yeah.  </p>

<p><em>GM</em> i guess an apology is in order then huh?  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> got it in one.  </p>

<p><em>MMouse</em> no, an appology wont suffice. just go away  </p>

<p><em>GM</em> o.k....if you say so!  </p>

<p></pre><p>  </p>

<p>However, not all males on IRC act in such a way and instead hold hope that  </p>

<p>the old power relations are being broken down:  <p></p>

<p><pre>  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> I just tend to be weary of guys who talk to me on IRC couse alot  </p>

<p>of them are just after one hting  </p>

<p><em>Lisabeth</em> I have no objection to you talking to me...  </p>

<p><em>YamaBushi</em> Well I guess u live in Sydney or something so that rules out  </p>

<p>sex. I can't see your facce or body so I can't lust after u I just like talking to  </p>

<p>women.. they are often better conversationalists than the typical Aussies male   </p>

<p></pre><p>  </p>

<p>It appears that while there is the potential for new power relations to develop,  </p>

<p>there are those who seek to replicate old patterns of inequality between the  </p>

<p>genders. It may be that instead of liberating society from the old inequalities,  </p>

<p>new forms of inequality have been formed. Feminists such as Jansen (1989)  </p>

<p>and Spender (1994) say that old patterns of power and privilege are being  </p>

<p>reproduced in information technologies. If women do not use the Internet, the  </p>

<p>old male domination will re-emerge and there could be a class of information  </p>

<p>rich who are male and a class of information poor who are female.  <p></p>

<p>Questions of power and gender cannot be removed from the use of  </p>

<p>technologies as they are inserted into existing power relations (Gray, 1993).  </p>

<p>However, this does not mean that there cannot be change, but that there is  </p>

<p>always the potential with new technologies for both &#8216;liberation&#8217; and  </p>

<p>&#8216;oppression&#8217;.  <p></p>
