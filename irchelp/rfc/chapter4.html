<h1>4. Message details</h1>

<p>On the following pages are descriptions of each message recognized by the IRC
server and client. All commands described in this section must be implemented
by any server for this protocol.</p>

<p>Where the reply ERR_NOSUCHSERVER is listed, it means that the <server>
parameter could not be found. The server must not send any other replies after
this for that command.</p>

<p>The server to which a client is connected is required to parse the complete
message, returning any appropriate errors. If the server encounters a fatal
error while parsing a message, an error must be sent back to the client and
the parsing terminated. A fatal error may be considered to be incorrect
command, a destination which is otherwise unknown to the server (server, nick
or channel names fit this category), not enough parameters or incorrect
privileges.</p>

<p>If a full set of parameters is presented, then each must be checked for
validity and appropriate responses sent back to the client. In the case of
messages which use parameter lists using the comma as an item separator, a
reply must be sent for each item.</p>

<p>In the examples below, some messages appear using the full format:</p>

<p><code>:Name COMMAND parameter list</code></p>

<p>Such examples represent a message from &#8220;Name&#8221; in transit between servers,
where it is essential to include the name of the original sender of the
message so remote servers may send back a reply along the correct path.</p>

<h2>4.1 Connection Registration</h2>

<p>The commands described here are used to register a connection with an IRC
server as either a user or a server as well as correctly disconnect.</p>

<p>A &#8220;PASS&#8221; command is not required for either client or server connection to be
registered, but it must precede the server message or the latter of the
NICK/USER combination. It is strongly recommended that all server connections
have a password in order to give some level of security to the actual
connections. The recommended order for a client to register is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pass message</li>
<li>Nick message</li>
<li>User message</li>
</ol>

<h3>4.1.1 Password message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>PASS</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><password></p>

<p>The PASS command is used to set a &#8216;connection password&#8217;. The password can and
must be set before any attempt to register the connection is made. Currently
this requires that clients send a PASS command before sending the NICK/USER
combination and servers <em>must</em> send a PASS command before any SERVER command.
The password supplied must match the one contained in the C/N lines (for
servers) or I lines (for clients). It is possible to send multiple PASS
commands before registering but only the last one sent is used for
verification and it may not be changed once registered. Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS</p>

<p>ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>PASS secretpasswordhere
</code></pre>

<h3>4.1.2 Nick message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>NICK</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><nickname> [ <hopcount> ]</p>

<p>NICK message is used to give user a nickname or change the previous one. The
<hopcount> parameter is only used by servers to indicate how far away a nick
is from its home server. A local connection has a hopcount of 0. If supplied
by a client, it must be ignored.</p>

<p>If a NICK message arrives at a server which already knows about an identical
nickname for another client, a nickname collision occurs. As a result of a
nickname collision, all instances of the nickname are removed from the
server&#8217;s database, and a KILL command is issued to remove the nickname from
all other server&#8217;s database. If the NICK message causing the collision was a
nickname change, then the original (old) nick must be removed as well.</p>

<p>If the server recieves an identical NICK from a client which is directly
connected, it may issue an ERR_NICKCOLLISION to the local client, drop the
NICK command, and not generate any kills.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>ERR_NONICKNAMEGIVEN</p>

<p>ERR_ERRONEUSNICKNAME</p>

<p>ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE</p>

<p>ERR_NICKCOLLISION</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>NICK Wiz                 ; Introducing new nick "Wiz".

:WiZ NICK Kilroy         ; WiZ changed his nickname to Kilroy.
</code></pre>

<h3>4.1.3 User message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>USER</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><username> <hostname> <servername> <realname></p>

<p>The USER message is used at the beginning of connection to specify the
username, hostname, servername and realname of s new user. It is also used in
communication between servers to indicate new user arriving on IRC, since only
after both USER and NICK have been received from a client does a user become
registered.</p>

<p>Between servers USER must to be prefixed with client&#8217;s NICKname. Note that
hostname and servername are normally ignored by the IRC server when the USER
command comes from a directly connected client (for security reasons), but
they are used in server to server communication. This means that a NICK must
always be sent to a remote server when a new user is being introduced to the
rest of the network before the accompanying USER is sent.</p>

<p>It must be noted that realname parameter must be the last parameter, because
it may contain space characters and must be prefixed with a colon (&#8216;:&#8217;) to
make sure this is recognised as such.</p>

<p>Since it is easy for a client to lie about its username by relying solely on
the USER message, the use of an &#8220;Identity Server&#8221; is recommended. If the host
which a user connects from has such a server enabled the username is set to
that as in the reply from the &#8220;Identity Server&#8221;.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS</p>

<p>ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>USER guest tolmoon tolsun :Ronnie Reagan
                      ; User registering themselves with a
                      username of "guest" and real name
                      "Ronnie Reagan".

:testnick USER guest tolmoon tolsun :Ronnie Reagan
                      ; message between servers with the
                      nickname for which the USER command
                      belongs to
</code></pre>

<h3>4.1.4 Server message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>SERVER</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><servername> <hopcount> <info></p>

<p>The server message is used to tell a server that the other end of a new
connection is a server. This message is also used to pass server data over
whole net. When a new server is connected to net, information about it be
broadcast to the whole network. <hopcount> is used to give all servers some
internal information on how far away all servers are. With a full server list,
it would be possible to construct a map of the entire server tree, but
hostmasks prevent this from being done.</p>

<p>The SERVER message must only be accepted from either (a) a connection which is
yet to be registered and is attempting to register as a server, or (b) an
existing connection to another server, in which case the SERVER message is
introducing a new server behind that server.</p>

<p>Most errors that occur with the receipt of a SERVER command result in the
connection being terminated by the destination host (target SERVER). Error
replies are usually sent using the &#8220;ERROR&#8221; command rather than the numeric
since the ERROR command has several useful properties which make it useful
here.</p>

<p>If a SERVER message is parsed and attempts to introduce a server which is
already known to the receiving server, the connection from which that message
must be closed (following the correct procedures), since a duplicate route to
a server has formed and the acyclic nature of the IRC tree broken.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>SERVER test.oulu.fi 1 :[tolsun.oulu.fi] Experimental server
                ; New server test.oulu.fi introducing
                itself and attempting to register.  The
                name in []'s is the hostname for the
                host running test.oulu.fi.

:tolsun.oulu.fi SERVER csd.bu.edu 5 :BU Central Server
                ; Server tolsun.oulu.fi is our uplink
                for csd.bu.edu which is 5 hops away.
</code></pre>

<h3>4.1.5 Oper</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>OPER</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><user> <password></p>

<p>OPER message is used by a normal user to obtain operator privileges. The
combination of <user> and <password> are required to gain Operator privileges.</p>

<p>If the client sending the OPER command supplies the correct password for the
given user, the server then informs the rest of the network of the new
operator by issuing a &#8220;MODE +o&#8221; for the clients nickname.</p>

<p>The OPER message is client-server only.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS</p>

<p>RPL_YOUREOPER</p>

<p>ERR_NOOPERHOST</p>

<p>ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>OPER foo bar          ; Attempt to register as an operator
                      using a username of "foo" and "bar" as
                      the password.
</code></pre>

<h3>4.1.6 Quit</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>QUIT</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[<Quit message>]</p>

<p>A client session is ended with a quit message. The server must close the
connection to a client which sends a QUIT message. If a &#8220;Quit Message&#8221; is
given, this will be sent instead of the default message, the nickname.</p>

<p>When netsplits (disconnecting of two servers) occur, the quit message is
composed of the names of two servers involved, separated by a space. The first
name is that of the server which is still connected and the second name is
that of the server that has become disconnected.</p>

<p>If, for some other reason, a client connection is closed without the client
issuing a QUIT command (e.g. client dies and EOF occurs on socket), the server
is required to fill in the quit message with some sort of message reflecting
the nature of the event which caused it to happen.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>None.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>QUIT :Gone to have lunch     ; Preferred message format.
</code></pre>

<h3>4.1.7 Server quit message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>SQUIT</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><server> <comment></p>

<p>The SQUIT message is needed to tell about quitting or dead servers. If a
server wishes to break the connection to another server it must send a SQUIT
message to the other server, using the the name of the other server as the
server parameter, which then closes its connection to the quitting server.</p>

<p>This command is also available operators to help keep a network of IRC servers
connected in an orderly fashion. Operators may also issue an SQUIT message for
a remote server connection. In this case, the SQUIT must be parsed by each
server inbetween the operator and the remote server, updating the view of the
network held by each server as explained below.</p>

<p>The <comment> should be supplied by all operators who execute a SQUIT for a
remote server (that is not connected to the server they are currently on) so
that other operators are aware for the reason of this action. The <comment> is
also filled in by servers which may place an error or similar message here.</p>

<p>Both of the servers which are on either side of the connection being closed
are required to to send out a SQUIT message (to all its other server
connections) for all other servers which are considered to be behind that
link.</p>

<p>Similarly, a QUIT message must be sent to the other connected servers rest of
the network on behalf of all clients behind that link. In addition to this,
all channel members of a channel which lost a member due to the split must be
sent a QUIT message.</p>

<p>If a server connection is terminated prematurely (e.g. the server on the other
end of the link died), the server which detects this disconnection is required
to inform the rest of the network that the connection has closed and fill in
the comment field with something appropriate.</p>

<h2>4.2 Channel operations</h2>

<p>This group of messages is concerned with manipulating channels, their
properties (channel modes), and their contents (typically clients). In
implementing these, a number of race conditions are inevitable when clients at
opposing ends of a network send commands which will ultimately clash. It is
also required that servers keep a nickname history to ensure that wherever a
<nick> parameter is given, the server check its history in case it has
recently been changed.</p>

<h3>4.2.1 Join message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>JOIN</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><channel>{,<channel>} [<key>{,<key>}]</p>

<p>The JOIN command is used by client to start listening a specific channel.
Whether or not a client is allowed to join a channel is checked only by the
server the client is connected to; all other servers automatically add the
user to the channel when it is received from other servers. The conditions
which affect this are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>the user must be invited if the channel is invite-only;</li>
<li>the user&#8217;s nick/username/hostname must not match any active bans;</li>
<li>the correct key (password) must be given if it is set.</li>
</ol>

<p>These are discussed in more detail under the MODE command (see section 4.2.3
for more details).</p>

<p>Once a user has joined a channel, they receive notice about all commands their
server receives which affect the channel. This includes MODE, KICK, PART, QUIT
and of course PRIVMSG/NOTICE. The JOIN command needs to be broadcast to all
servers so that each server knows where to find the users who are on the
channel. This allows optimal delivery of PRIVMSG/NOTICE messages to the
channel.</p>

<p>If a JOIN is successful, the user is then sent the channel&#8217;s topic (using
RPL<em>TOPIC) and the list of users who are on the channel (using RPL</em>NAMREPLY),
which must include the user joining.</p>

<h3>4.2.2 Part message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<h3>4.2.3 Mode message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>MODE</p>

<p>The MODE command is a dual-purpose command in IRC. It allows both usernames
and channels to have their mode changed. The rationale for this choice is that
one day nicknames will be obsolete and the equivalent property will be the
channel.</p>

<p>When parsing MODE messages, it is recommended that the entire message be
parsed first and then the changes which resulted then passed on.</p>

<h4>4.2.3.1 Channel modes</h4>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><channel> {[+|-]|o|p|s|i|t|n|b|v} [<limit>] [<user>] [<ban mask>]</p>

<p>The MODE command is provided so that channel operators may change the
characteristics of `their&#8217; channel. It is also required that servers be able
to change channel modes so that channel operators may be created.</p>

<p>The various modes available for channels are as follows:</p>

<p>o</p>

<pre><code> - give/take channel operator privileges;
</code></pre>

<p>p</p>

<pre><code> - private channel flag;
</code></pre>

<p>s</p>

<pre><code> - secret channel flag;
</code></pre>

<p>i</p>

<pre><code> - invite-only channel flag;
</code></pre>

<p>t</p>

<pre><code> - topic settable by channel operator only flag;
</code></pre>

<p>n</p>

<pre><code> - no messages to channel from clients on the outside;
</code></pre>

<p>m</p>

<pre><code> - moderated channel;
</code></pre>

<p>l</p>

<pre><code> - set the user limit to channel;
</code></pre>

<p>b</p>

<pre><code> - set a ban mask to keep users out;
</code></pre>

<p>v</p>

<pre><code> - give/take the ability to speak on a moderated channel;
</code></pre>

<p>k</p>

<pre><code> - set a channel key (password).
</code></pre>

<p>When using the &#8216;o&#8217; and &#8216;b&#8217; options, a restriction on a total of three per mode
command has been imposed. That is, any combination of &#8216;o&#8217; and</p>

<h4>4.2.3.2 User modes</h4>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><nickname> {[+|-]|i|w|s|o}</p>

<p>The user MODEs are typically changes which affect either how the client is
seen by others or what &#8216;extra&#8217; messages the client is sent. A user MODE
command may only be accepted if both the sender of the message and the
nickname given as a parameter are both the same.</p>

<p>The available modes are as follows:</p>

<p>i</p>

<pre><code> - marks a users as invisible;
</code></pre>

<p>s</p>

<pre><code> - marks a user for receipt of server notices;
</code></pre>

<p>w</p>

<pre><code> - user receives wallops;
</code></pre>

<p>o</p>

<pre><code> - operator flag
</code></pre>

<p>Additional modes may be available later on.</p>

<p>If a user attempts to make themselves an operator using the &#8220;+o&#8221; flag, the
attempt should be ignored. There is no restriction, however, on anyone
`deopping&#8217; themselves (using &#8220;-o&#8221;).</p>

MODE WiZ -o              ; WiZ 'deopping' (removing operator
                         status).  The plain reverse of this
                         command ("MODE WiZ +o") must not be
                         allowed from users since would bypass

<h3>4.2.4 Topic message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>TOPIC</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><channel> [<topic>]</p>

<p>The TOPIC message is used to change or view the topic of a channel. The topic

<h3>4.2.5 Names message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>NAMES</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[<channel>{,<channel>}]</p>

<p>By using the NAMES command, a user can list all nicknames that are visible to
them on any channel that they can see. Channel names which they can see are
those which aren&#8217;t private (+p) or secret (+s) or those which they are
actually on. The <channel> parameter specifies which channel(s) to return
information about if valid. There is no error reply for bad channel names.</p>

<p>If no <channel> parameter is given, a list of all channels and their occupants
is returned. At the end of this list, a list of users who are visible but
either not on any channel or not on a visible channel are listed as being on
`channel&#8217; &#8220;*&#8221;.</p>

<h3>4.2.6 List message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>LIST</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[<channel>{,<channel>} [<server>]]</p>

<p>The list message is used to list channels and their topics. If the <channel>
parameter is used, only the status of that channel is displayed. Private
channels are listed (without their topics) as channel &#8220;Prv&#8221; unless the client
generating the query is actually on that channel. Likewise, secret channels
are not listed at all unless the client is a member of the channel in
question.</p>

<h3>4.2.7 Invite message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>INVITE</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><nickname> <channel></p>

<p>The INVITE message is used to invite users to a channel. The parameter
<nickname> is the nickname of the person to be invited to the target channel
<channel>. There is no requirement that the channel the target user is being
invited to must exist or be a valid channel. To invite a user to a channel
which is invite only (MODE +i), the client sending the invite must be
recognised as being a channel operator on the given channel.</p>

<h3>4.2.8 Kick command</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>KICK</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><channel> <user> [<comment>]</p>

<p>The KICK command can be used to forcibly remove a user from a channel. It
&#8216;kicks them out&#8217; of the channel (forced PART).</p>

<p>Only a channel operator may kick another user out of a channel. Each server
that receives a KICK message checks that it is valid (ie the sender is
actually a channel operator) before removing the victim from the channel.</p>

<p>NOTE:</p>

<p>It is possible to extend the KICK command parameters to the following:</p>

<p><channel>{,<channel>} <user>{,<user>} [<comment>]</p>

<h2>4.3 Server queries and commands</h2>

<p>The server query group of commands has been designed to return information
about any server which is connected to the network. All servers connected must
respond to these queries and respond correctly. Any invalid response (or lack
thereof) must be considered a sign of a broken server and it must be
disconnected/disabled as soon as possible until the situation is remedied.</p>

<p>In these queries, where a parameter appears as &#8220;<server>&#8221;, it will usually
mean it can be a nickname or a server or a wildcard name of some sort. For
each parameter, however, only one query and set of replies is to be generated.</p>

<h3>4.3.1 Version message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>VERSION</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[<server>]</p>

<p>The VERSION message is used to query the version of the server program. An
optional parameter <server> is used to query the version of the server program
which a client is not directly connected to.</p>

</code></pre>

<h3>4.3.2 Stats message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>STATS</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[<query> [<server>]]</p>

<p>The stats message is used to query statistics of certain server. If <server>
parameter is omitted, only the end of stats reply is sent back. The
implementation of this command is highly dependent on the server which
replies, although the server must be able to supply information as described
by the queries below (or similar).</p>

<p>A query may be given by any single letter which is only checked by the
destination server (if given as the <server> parameter) and is otherwise
passed on by intermediate servers, ignored and unaltered. The following
queries are those found in the current IRC implementation and provide a large
portion of the setup information for that server. Although these may not be
supported in the same way by other versions, all servers should be able to
supply a valid reply to a STATS query which is consistent with the reply
formats currently used and the purpose of the query.</p>

<p>The currently supported queries are:</p>

<p>c</p>

<pre><code> - returns a list of servers which the server may connect to or allow connections from;
</code></pre>

<p>h</p>

<pre><code> - returns a list of servers which are either forced to be treated as leaves or allowed to act as hubs;
</code></pre>

<p>i</p>

<pre><code> - returns a list of hosts which the server allows a client to connect from;
</code></pre>

<p>k</p>

<pre><code> - returns a list of banned username/hostname combinations for that server;
</code></pre>

<p>l</p>

<pre><code> - returns a list of the server's connections, showing how long each connection has been established and the traffic over that connection in bytes and messages for each direction;
</code></pre>

<p>m</p>

<pre><code> - returns a list of commands supported by the server and the usage count for each if the usage count is non zero;
</code></pre>

<p>o</p>

<pre><code> - returns a list of hosts from which normal clients may become operators;
</code></pre>

<p>y</p>

<pre><code> - show Y (Class) lines from server's configuration file;
</code></pre>

<p>u</p>

<pre><code> - returns a string showing how long the server has been up.

<p>Command:</p>

<p>LINKS</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[[<remote server>] <server mask>]</p>

<p>With LINKS, a user can list all servers which are known by the server
answering the query. The returned list of servers must match the mask, or if
no mask is given, the full list is returned.</p>

<p>If <remote server> is given in addition to <server mask>, the LINKS command is
forwarded to the first server found that matches that name (if any), and that
server is then required to answer the query.</p>

<h3>4.3.5 Connect message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>CONNECT</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><target server> [<port> [<remote server>]]</p>

<p>The CONNECT command can be used to force a server to try to establish a new
connection to another server immediately. CONNECT is a privileged command and
is to be available only to IRC Operators. If a remote server is given then the
CONNECT attempt is made by that server to <target server> and <port>.</p>

<h3>4.3.6 Trace message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>TRACE</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[<server>]</p>

<p>TRACE command is used to find the route to specific server. Each server that
processes this message must tell the sender about it by sending a reply
indicating it is a pass-through link, forming a chain of replies similar to
that gained from using &#8220;traceroute&#8221;. After sending this reply back, it must
then send the TRACE message to the next server until given server is reached.
If the <server> parameter is omitted, it is recommended that TRACE command
send a message to the sender telling which servers the current server has
direct connection to.</p>

<p>If the destination given by &#8220;<server>&#8221; is an actual server, then the
destination server is required to report all servers and users which are
connected to it, although only operators are permitted to see users present.
If the destination given by <server> is a nickname, they only a reply for that
nickname is given.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>If the TRACE message is destined for another server, all intermediate servers
must return a RPL_TRACELINK reply to indicate that the TRACE passed through it

<h2>4.4 Sending messages</h2>

<p>The main purpose of the IRC protocol is to provide a base for clients to
communicate with each other. PRIVMSG and NOTICE are the only messages
available which actually perform delivery of a text message from one client to
another - the rest just make it possible and try to ensure it happens in a
reliable and structured manner.</p>

<h3>4.4.1 Private messages</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>PRIVMSG</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><receiver>{,<receiver>} <text to be sent></p>

<p>PRIVMSG is used to send private messages between users. <receiver> is the
nickname of the receiver of the message. <receiver> can also be a list of
names or channels separated with commas.</p>

<p>The <receiver> parameter may also me a host mask (#mask) or server mask
($mask). In both cases the server will only send the PRIVMSG to those who have
a server or host matching the mask. The mask must have at least 1 (one) &#8220;.&#8221; in
it and no wildcards following the last &#8220;.&#8221;. This requirement exists to prevent
people sending messages to &#8220;#<em>&#8221; or &#8220;$</em>&#8221;, which would broadcast to all users;
from experience, this is abused more than used responsibly and properly.
Wildcards are the &#8216;*&#8217; and &#8216;?&#8217; characters. This extension to the PRIVMSG
command is only available to Operators.</p>

<p>ERR_WILDTOPLEVEL</p>

<p>ERR_TOOMANYTARGETS</p>

<p>ERR_NOSUCHNICK</p>

<p>RPL_AWAY</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>:Angel PRIVMSG Wiz :Hello are you receiving this message ?
                       ; Message from Angel to Wiz.

PRIVMSG Angel :yes I'm receiving it !receiving it !'u&gt;(768u+1n) .br
                       ; Message to Angel.

PRIVMSG jto@tolsun.oulu.fi :Hello !
                       ; Message to a client on server
                       tolsun.oulu.fi with username of "jto".

PRIVMSG $*.fi :Server tolsun.oulu.fi rebooting.
                       ; Message to everyone on a server which
                       has a name matching *.fi.

PRIVMSG #*.edu :NSFNet is undergoing work, expect interruptions
                       ; Message to all users who come from a
                       host which has a name matching *.edu.
</code></pre>

<h3>4.4.2 Notice</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>NOTICE</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><nickname> <text></p>

<p>The NOTICE message is used similarly to PRIVMSG. The difference between NOTICE
and PRIVMSG is that automatic replies must never be sent in response to a
NOTICE message. This rule applies to servers too - they must not send any
error reply back to the client on receipt of a notice. The object of this rule
is to avoid loops between a client automatically sending something in response
to something it received. This is typically used by automatons (clients with
either an AI or other interactive program controlling their actions) which are
always seen to be replying lest they end up in a loop with another automaton.</p>

<p>See PRIVMSG for more details on replies and examples.</p>

<h2>4.5 User based queries</h2>

<p>User queries are a group of commands which are primarily concerned with
finding details on a particular user or group users. When using wildcards with
any of these commands, if they match, they will only return information on
users who are &#8216;visible&#8217; to you. The visibility of a user is determined as a
combination of the user&#8217;s mode and the common set of channels you are both on.</p>

<h3>4.5.1 Who query</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>WHO</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[<name> [<o>]]</p>

<p>The WHO message is used by a client to generate a query which returns a list
of information which &#8216;matches&#8217; the <name> parameter given by the client. In
the absence of the <name> parameter, all visible (users who aren&#8217;t invisible
(user mode +i) and who don&#8217;t have a common channel with the requesting client)
are listed. The same result can be achieved by using a <name> of &#8220;0&#8221; or any
wildcard which will end up matching every entry possible.</p>

<p>The <name> passed to WHO is matched against users&#8217; host, server, real name and
nickname if the channel <name> cannot be found.</p>

<p>If the &#8220;o&#8221; parameter is passed only operators are returned according to the
name mask supplied.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

WHO jto* o           ; List all users with a match against
                     "jto*" if they are an operator.
</code></pre>

<h3>4.5.2 Whois query</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>WHOIS</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p>[<server>] <nickmask>[,<nickmask>[,&#8230;]]</p>

<p>This message is used to query information about particular user. The server
will answer this message with several numeric messages indicating different
statuses of each user which matches the nickmask (if you are entitled to see
them). If no wildcard is present in the <nickmask>, any information about that
nick which you are allowed to see is presented. A comma (&#8216;,&#8217;) separated list
of nicknames may be given.</p>

<p>The latter version sends the query to a specific server. It is useful if you
want to know how long the user in question has been idle as only local server
(ie. the server the user is directly connected to) knows that information,
while everything else is globally known.</p>

</code></pre>

<h3>4.5.3 Whowas</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>WHOWAS</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><nickname> [<count> [<server>]]</p>

<p>Whowas asks for information about a nickname which no longer exists. This may
either be due to a nickname change or the user leaving IRC. In response to
this query, the server searches through its nickname history, looking for any
nicks which are lexically the same (no wild card matching here). The history
is searched backward, returning the most recent entry first. If there are
multiple entries, up to <count> replies will be returned (or all of them if no
<count> parameter is given). If a non-positive number is passed as being
<count>, then a full search is done.</p>

                          entries in the nick history for
                          "Mermaid";

WHOWAS Trillian 1 *.edu   ; return the most recent history for
                          "Trillian" from the first server found
                          to match "*.edu".

<h2>4.6 Miscellaneous messages</h2>

<p>Messages in this category do not fit into any of the above categories but are
nonetheless still a part of and required by the protocol.</p>

<h3>4.6.1 Kill message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>KILL</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><nickname> <comment></p>

<p>The KILL message is used to cause a client-server connection to be closed by
the server which has the actual connection. KILL is used by servers when they
encounter a duplicate entry in the list of valid nicknames and is used to
remove both entries. It is also available to operators.</p>

<p>Clients which have automatic reconnect algorithms effectively make this
command useless since the disconnection is only brief. It does however break
the flow of data and can be used to stop large amounts of being abused, any
user may elect to receive KILL messages generated for others to keep an &#8216;eye&#8217;
on would be trouble spots.</p>

<p>In an arena where nicknames are required to be globally unique at all times,
KILL messages are sent whenever &#8216;duplicates&#8217; are detected (that is an attempt
to register two users with the same nickname) in the hope that both of them
will disappear and only 1 reappear.</p>

<p>The comment given must reflect the actual reason for the KILL. For server-
generated KILLs it usually is made up of details concerning the origins of the
two conflicting nicknames. For users it is left up to them to provide an
adequate reason to satisfy others who see it. To prevent/discourage fake KILLs
from being generated to hide the identify of the KILLer, the comment also
shows a &#8216;kill-path&#8217; which is updated by each server it passes through, each
prepending its name to the path.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>ERR_NOPRIVILEGES</p>

<p>ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS</p>

<p>ERR_NOSUCHNICK</p>

<p>ERR_CANTKILLSERVER</p>

<pre><code>KILL David (csd.bu.edu &lt;- tolsun.oulu.fi)
                    ; Nickname collision between csd.bu.edu
                    and tolson.oulu.fi
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE:</p>

<p>It is recommended that only Operators be allowed to kill other users with KILL
message. In an ideal world not even operators would need to do this and it
would be left to servers to deal with.</p>

<h3>4.6.2 Ping message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>PING</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><server1> [<server2>]</p>

<p>The PING message is used to test the presence of an active client at the other
end of the connection. A PING message is sent at regular intervals if no other
activity detected coming from a connection. If a connection fails to respond
to a PING command within a set amount of time, that connection is closed.</p>

<p>Any client which receives a PING message must respond to <server1> (server
which sent the PING message out) as quickly as possible with an appropriate
PONG message to indicate it is still there and alive. Servers should not
respond to PING commands but rely on PINGs from the other end of the
connection to indicate the connection is alive. If the <server2> parameter is
specified, the PING message gets forwarded there.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>ERR_NOORIGIN</p>

<p>ERR_NOSUCHSERVER</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>PING tolsun.oulu.fi  ; server sending a PING message to
                     another server to indicate it is still
                     alive.

PING WiZ             ; PING message being sent to nick WiZ
</code></pre>

<h3>4.6.3 Pong message</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>PONG</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><daemon> [<daemon2>]</p>

<p>PONG message is a reply to ping message. If parameter <daemon2> is given this
message must be forwarded to given daemon. The <daemon> parameter is the name
of the daemon who has responded to PING message and generated this message.</p>

<p>Numeric Replies:</p>

<p>ERR_NOORIGIN</p>

<p>ERR_NOSUCHSERVER</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>PONG csd.bu.edu tolsun.oulu.fi
                   ; PONG message from csd.bu.edu to
</code></pre>

<h3>4.6.4 Error</h3>

<p>Command:</p>

<p>ERROR</p>

<p>Parameters:</p>

<p><error message></p>

<p>The ERROR command is for use by servers when reporting a serious or fatal
error to its operators. It may also be sent from one server to another but
must not be accepted from any normal unknown clients.</p>

<p>An ERROR message is for use for reporting errors which occur with a server-to-
server link only. An ERROR message is sent to the server at the other end
(which sends it to all of its connected operators) and to all operators
currently connected. It is not to be passed onto any other servers by a server
if it is received from a server.</p>

<p>When a server sends a received ERROR message to its operators, the message
should be encapsulated inside a NOTICE message, indicating that the client was
not responsible for the error.</p>

<p>Numerics:</p>

<p>None.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR :Server *.fi already exists
                    ; ERROR message to the other server
                    which caused this error.

NOTICE WiZ :ERROR from csd.bu.edu -- Server *.fi already exists
                    ; Same ERROR message as above but sent
                    to user WiZ on the other server.
